  Scenario Outline: Verify I can make 1:1 call to <CallBackend>
    Given There are 2 users where <Name> is me
    Given Myself is connected to <Contact>
    Given <Contact> starts instance using <CallBackend>
    Given <Contact> accepts next incoming call automatically
    Given I sign in using my email
    Given I see conversations list
    When I tap on contact name <Contact>
    And I tap Audio Call button
    And I accept alert
    Then <Contact> verifies that waiting instance status is changed to active in <Timeout> seconds
    And I see Calling overlay
    And <Contact> verifies to have 1 flow
    And <Contact> verifies that all flows have greater than 0 bytes
    When I tap Leave button on Calling overlay
    Then I do not see Calling overlay

    Examples:
      | Name      | Contact   | CallBackend          | Timeout |
      | user1Name | user2Name | chrome:51.0.2704.106 | 20      |
