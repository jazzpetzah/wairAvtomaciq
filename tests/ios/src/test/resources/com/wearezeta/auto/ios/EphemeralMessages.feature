Feature: Ephemeral Messages

  @C259591 @staging @fastLogin
  Scenario Outline: Verify ephemeral messages don't leave a trace in the database
    Given There are 2 users where <Name> is me
    Given Myself is connected to <Contact>
    Given User <Contact> adds new device <DeviceName>
    Given I sign in using my email or phone number
    Given I see conversations list
    Given I tap on contact name <Contact>
    Given I tap Hourglass button in conversation view
    Given I set ephemeral messages expiration timer to <Timeout> seconds
    Given I type the default message and send it
    Given I see 1 default message in the conversation view
    When I remember the recent message from user Myself in the local database
    And I wait for <Timeout> seconds
    Then I see 0 default messages in the conversation view
    And I verify the remembered message has been changed in the local database
    When User <Contact> switches user Myself to ephemeral mode with <Timeout> seconds timeout
    And User <Contact> sends 1 encrypted message to user Myself
    # Wait for the message to be delivered
    And I wait for 3 seconds
    And I see 1 default message in the conversation view
    And I remember the state of the recent message from user <Contact> in the local database
    And I wait for <Timeout> seconds
    Then I verify the remembered message has been deleted from the local database

    Examples:
      | Name      | Contact   | DeviceName    | Timeout |
      | user1Name | user2Name | ContactDevice | 15      |
