  Scenario Outline: Receive updated content when changing from offline to online
    Given There are 2 users where <Name> is me
    Given <Contact> is connected to me
    Given I sign in using my email or phone number
    Given I accept First Time overlay as soon as it is visible
    Given I see Conversations list with conversations
    And I tap on conversation name <Contact>
    When User <Contact> sends encrypted message <Message1> to user Myself
    Then I see the most recent conversation message is "<Message1>"
    When I enable Airplane mode on the device
    And I see No Internet bar in 15 seconds
    And User <Contact> sends encrypted image <Picture> to single user conversation <Name>
    Then I do not see any pictures in the conversation view
    When User <Contact> sends encrypted message <Message2> to user Myself
    Then I see the most recent conversation message is "<Message1>"
    When I disable Airplane mode on the device
    And I do not see No Internet bar in 15 seconds
    # Wait for sync
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    And I scroll to the bottom of conversation view
