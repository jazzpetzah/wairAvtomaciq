Feature: Emoji

  @C162664 @regression @rc
  Scenario Outline: Verify that received message containing emoji characters only is 3 times bigger, than normal text messages
    Given There are 2 users where <Name> is me
    Given <Contact> is connected to me
    Given I sign in using my email or phone number
    Given I accept First Time overlay as soon as it is visible
    Given User <Contact> sends encrypted message <NormalText> to user Myself
    Given User <Contact> sends encrypted message <EmojiText> to user Myself
    Given I see Conversations list with conversations
    When I tap on conversation name <Contact>
    Then I see that the difference in height of "<EmojiText>" and "<NormalText>" messages is greater than <MinHeightDiff> percent

    Examples:
      | Name      | Contact   | NormalText | EmojiText | MinHeightDiff |
      | user1Name | user2Name | Yo         | ðŸ‘¿        | 120           |

    Given User <Contact> sends encrypted message <MixedText> to user Myself
    Given I see Conversations list with conversations
    When I tap on conversation name <Contact>
    Then I see that the difference in height of "<MixedText>" and "<NormalText>" messages is not greater than <MaxHeightDiff> percent

    Examples:

      | user1Name | user2Name | Yo         | ðŸ‘¿?       | 20            |
