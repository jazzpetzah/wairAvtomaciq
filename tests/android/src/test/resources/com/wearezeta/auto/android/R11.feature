  Scenario Outline: Register new user by phone and set profile picture using camera 11
    Given I see welcome screen
    When I input a new phone number for user <Name>
    And I input the verification code
    And I input my name
    And I select to choose my own picture
    And I select Camera as picture source
    And I tap Take Photo button on Take Picture view
    And I tap Confirm button on Take Picture view
    Then I see Conversations list with no conversations
