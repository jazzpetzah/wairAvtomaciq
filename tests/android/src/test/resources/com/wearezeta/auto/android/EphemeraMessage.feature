  @C261701 @C261702 @C261703 @staging
  Scenario Outline: Verify sending ephemeral text message, which will be obfuscated and not been delivered to my other devices
    Given There is 2 users where <Name> is me
    Given Myself is connected to <Contact>
    Given I sign in using my email or phone number
    Given I accept First Time overlay as soon as it is visible
    Given User Myself adds new device <Mydevice>
    Given I see Conversations list with conversations
    Given I tap on conversation name <Contact>
    # C261701 & C261703
    When User Myself remembers the recent message from user <Contact> via device <Mydevice>
    And I tap Ephemeral button from cursor toolbar
    And I set timeout to <EphemeralTimeout> on Extended cursor ephemeral overlay
    And I type the message "<Message>" and send it by cursor Send button
    Then I see the message "<Message>" in the conversation view
    And I see Message status with expected text "<EphemeralStatus>" in conversation view
    When I wait for 5 seconds
    Then I see Message status with expected text "Sent" in conversation view
    And I do not see the message "<Message>" in the conversation view
    And User Myself sees the recent message from user <Contact> via device <Mydevice> is not changed in 5 seconds
    # C261702
    When I tap Ephemeral button from cursor toolbar
    And I set timeout to Off on Extended cursor ephemeral overlay
    And I type the message "<Message2>" and send it by cursor Send button
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    Then I see Message status with expected text "Sent" in conversation view
    And I see the message "<Message2>" in the conversation view
    And User Myself sees the recent message from user <Contact> via device <Mydevice> is changed in 15 seconds

    Examples:
