You own the media on which the Software is recorded, if any, but PreForm and/or PreForm's licensor(s) retain ownership of the Software itself. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by PreForm that replace and/or supplement the original Software product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.\
