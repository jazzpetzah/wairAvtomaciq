1. General.
\b0  The software described above, together with documentation accompanying this License, whether on disk, in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively the "Software") is licensed, not given or sold, to you by PreForm Assistive Technologies, LLC ("PreForm") for use only under the terms of this License, and PreForm reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. This License applies only to the Software. It does not apply to any application or other software distributed with the Software; instead, any such application or other software is governed by a separate license. The rights granted herein are limited to PreForm's and its licensors' intellectual property rights in the Software and do not include any patents or other intellectual property rights. You own the media on which the Software is recorded, if any, but PreForm and/or PreForm's licensor(s) retain ownership of the Software itself. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by PreForm that replace and/or supplement the original Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.\
\

\b 2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.
\b0  This License allows you to duplicate, publish and distribute the Software, and to enable it to be installed and used, in conjunction with the Product described above (the "Product") that you publish or distribute, including all future revisions and versions of such Product, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this License.\

\cf0 The Software is free of charge for use during development of any client application or other software. It is also free of charge for publication and distribution with the Product if and so long as you distribute the Product free of charge (including freeware as well as free beta or trial versions of a product for which you intend to request or require payment in the future). You shall, prior to the first publication or distribution of the Product, (a) fill out, sign and mail this distribution license form to PreForm at its address as shown on the PreForm Web site at pfiddlesoft.com; (b) provide attribution to PreForm in your client application or other software, and its documentation; and (c) include the copyright notice and single user license with your client application or other software.\
\
If you request or require payment for the Product with which you publish or distribute the Software or which makes use of the Software, whether you denominate such Product as donationware, shareware, commercial software or otherwise, or if you publish or distribute such Product for internal use within a for-profit organization, you shall, prior to the first publication or distribution of the Product, (a) fill out, sign and mail this distribution license form to PreForm at its address as shown on the PreForm Web site at pfiddlesoft.com; (b) provide attribution to PreForm in your client application or other software, and its documentation; and (c) include the copyright notice and single user license with your client application or other software.

This per-product fee covers all present and future revisions and versions of the Product, but any separate and distinct product, including a "Pro" or "Extended" or similar separate edition of the Product, for which you request or require payment requires you to pay PreForm an additional licensing fee of $250 U.S.\

This License and any applicable per-product fee covers the current release version of the Software and any future versions of the Software that may be released by PreForm. This License does not entitle you to receive the source code for the Software, which is available only for an additional fee.
