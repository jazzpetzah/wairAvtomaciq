 @copyright 2003-2012 Bill Cheeseman. Used by permission. All rights reserved.
 @version 3.2.0
 @abstract PFUIElement.h supports reading and controlling a UI element in a running application.
 @discussion The accessibility API implements the concept of a "UI element," an object based on Core Foundation's CFTypeRef type that represents a user interface element on the screen in a running application. PFUIElement.h implements this same concept in its PFUIElement and PFApplicationUIElement classes.
 
 The following preprocessor macros are used in this header:
 <ul><li><b>PFA_DEBUG</b> Defining this macro causes the framework to log information about accessibility API errors to stderr.
 <li><b>PFA_BLOCK_EXPECTED_ERROR_LOGS</b> Defining this macro when PFA_DEBUG is also defined suppresses logging of accessibility API errors in certain situations where normal usage is expected to generate errors, in order to prevent flooding stderr with uninteresting error messages.</ul>
 It is recommended that you set both of these macros in the framework Target's Preprocessor Macros build setting for the Debug configuration only.

 @class PFUIElement
 @abstract A concrete class representing a UI element in a running application.
 @discussion A PFUIElement object represents a UI element on the screen in a running application, such as a menu, window or button. The PFApplicationUIElement subclass represents a root-level UI element&mdash;either an application or the system-wide element representing all running applications.
 
 The PFUIElement class implements all of the functionality of the accessibility API's AXUIElementRef object. A PFApplicationUIElement subclass implements additional AXUIElementRef functionality relating to the root application element and the system-wide element. PFUIElement objects fully support the accessibility API's actions, attributes, keystrokes and notifications. A client application can get the value of a PFUIElement object's attributes, set the value of its settable attributes, and perform any actions it supports. It can send keystrokes, including keyboard shortcuts, to the focused UI element in a target application. And, by creating a PFObserver object, it can observe any application or UI element and receive notifications when changes occur.
 
 In this documentation, depending on context, "UI element" or "element" may refer either to a programmatic PFUIElement or PFApplicationUIElement object or to the user interface object in the running application that is represented by a PFUIElement or PFApplicationUIElement object. References to a "PFUIElement object" generally include a PFApplicationUIElement object, since the PFApplicationUIElement class is a subclass of PFUIElement.
 
 An application's UI elements are organized in a tree-like containment hierarchy of PFUIElement objects, with the root application element on one end and leaf elements on the screen such as buttons and checkboxes on the other. A target application's hierarchy can be navigated in either direction by traversing any element's parent and children. An application's individual elements can be read by getting their attributes, and in many cases they can be controlled by setting their attributes and performing actions on them and by sending keystrokes to the application. Methods are provided to obtain the application's root element given its path or its process identification number (PID) as an entry point into the tree, or, alternatively, to read the screen to obtain the root UI element of whatever application currently has a user interface object at a specified point on the screen.
 
 UI elements have attributes and, in many cases, actions identified by a string, usually beginning with the prefix "AX" as in "AXRole" or "AXPress". In a client application, you normally use the NSString constants declared in the NSAccessibility informal protocol (in NSAccessibility.h, in the Cocoa AppKit framework). Alternatively, you can use the corresponding CFStringRef constants declared in the accessibility API headers and cast them to NSString*, or use the string itself. Some constants are omitted from NSAccessibility.h or from the accessibility API headers; if you can't find a desired constant in one of these headers, use a constant from the other header or the string itself. Note that some constants in these headers may be marked as obsolete; use only the non-obsolete constants or their string equivalents to maximize compatibility with future releases of Mac OS X.
 
 Some applications, such as the Finder and Safari, implement custom UI elements with custom actions and attributes that are not part of Apple's accessibility API. This framework is written so that you can read and manipulate them as well as Apple's built-in accessibility API actions and attributes.  You may be able to identify the strings used to identify custom actions and attributes by reading an application's documentation or by examining the .strings files in its application bundle. You will find it much easier, however, to use PreForm UI Browser, available from PreForm Assistive Technologies, LLC at <a href="http://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/">pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/</a>.
 
 Many methods return PFUIElement or PFApplicationUIElement objects. Think of these methods as factories that can be called upon to churn out these objects as often as needed, whenever needed, even if you use them only for a moment. Separate PFUIElement or PFApplicationUIElement objects representing the same UI element in the running application are interchangeable. Whether they represent the same element can be tested using <code>-isEqual:</code> or @link isEqualToElement: -isEqualToElement:@/link. Whether the element still exists in the running application can be tested using @link exists -exists@/link or @link isDestroyed -isDestroyed @/link. It is prudent to test whether an element still exists before using it, because objects representing destroyed elements may be <code>nil</code> or may have been recycled to refer to other elements, leading to unexpected behavior.
 
 Clients should not subclass PFUIElement, because they would lose access to PFApplicationUIElement. Instead, they should use categories or similar techniques to add functionality to PFUIElement.

 The following new roles and subroles were introduced in Mac OS X v10.6: NSAccessibilityLevelIndicatorRole, NSAccessibilityCellRole, NSAccessibilityLayoutAreaRole, NSAccessibilityLayoutItemRole, NSAccessibilityHandleRole, NSAccessibilitySortButtonSubrole, NSAccessibilityRatingIndicatorSubrole, NSAccessibilityContentListSubrole, and NSAccessibilityDefinitionListSubrole. NSAccessibilitySortButtonRole is available but deprecated in Mac OS X v10.6. The following new roles and subroles were introduced in Mac OS X v10.7: NSAccessibilityPopoverRole, NSAccessibilityFullScreenButtonSubrole and kAXSeparatorDockItemSubrole. The availability of attributes that were introduced in Mac OS X v10.6 and v10.7 are noted in individual methods in the Attributes category.
 
 Before a client application can make use of this class, the "Enable access for assistive devices" setting in the Accessibility (or Universal Access) pane of System Preferences must be turned on, or the client application must be made a trusted process through use of the accessibility API's <code>AXMakeProcessTrusted()</code> function. Authentication may be required.

// The designated initializer for a PFUIElement object is -initWithElementRef:delegate:.

/*!
 @method initWithElementRef:delegate:
 @abstract Initializes and returns a newly allocated PFUIElement object.
 @param uiElementRef An opaque accessibility API object representing a UI element in the target application.
 @param aDelegate An object that may implement the optional @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link or @link PFUIElementReportError: -PFUIElementReportError: @/link delegate method. May be <code>nil</code>.
 @result An initialized PFUIElement or PFApplicationUIElement object, or <code>nil</code> if the target application is not running or the UI element does not exist in the target application's user interface.
 @discussion This is the designated initializer for the PFUIElement class. Use it to initialize a newly-allocated PFUIElement object with <code>uiElementRef</code>, an opaque accessibility API AXUIElementRef object.
 
 The <code>uiElementRef</code> argument may be obtained by sending @link elementRef -elementRef @/link to any valid PFUIElement or PFApplicationUIElement object, or by calling any of several accessibility API functions. You may pass <code>nil</code>, but then you are responsible for calling @link setElementRef: -setElementRef: @/link with a <i>uiElementRef</i> object and @link setElementInfo: -setElementInfo: @/link before you use the new PFUIElement object.
 
 The object passed in the <code>aDelegate</code> argument, if it implements the optional @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link delegate method, is automatically registered to receive <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code> when the UI element represented by the new PFUIElement object is destroyed (for example, when a window closes). Pass <code>nil</code> if you don't need to know when the element is destroyed. 
  
 Although this is the designated initializer for the PFUIElement class, a client application normally creates and initializes a new PFUIElement object in one of the four ways listed here, instead of  allocating a new PFUIElement object and sending it the <code>-initWithElementRef:delegate:</code> message:
 
 1. with PFUIElement's @link elementAtPoint:withDelegate:error: +elementAtPoint:withDelegate:error: @/link class method or PFApplicationUIElement's @link elementAtPoint: -elementAtPoint: @/link instance method, when you want to browse an application's UI elements from a leaf element by reading the screen;
 
 2. with PFApplicationUIElement's @link initWithPath:delegate: -initWithPath:delegate: @/link, @link initWithURL:delegate: -initWithURL:delegate: @/link, @link initWithBundleIdentifier:delegate: -initWithBundleIdentifier:delegate: @/link or @link initWithPid:delegate: -initWithPid:delegate: @/link method, or their corresponding convenience factory methods, when you want to browse an application's UI elements from its root application element without reading the screen;
 
 3. with PFApplicationUIElement's @link initSystemWideWithDelegate: -initSystemWideWithDelegate: @/link method, or its corresponding convenience factory method, when you want to use the system-wide UI element to access the active application's elements; or
 
 4. with any of several methods, such as @link applicationElement -applicationElement@/link, @link AXParent -AXParent @/link and @link AXChildren -AXChildren@/link, that return a PFUIElement object or an array of PFUIElement objects related to a given element, when you already have a PFUIElement object and can use it as the receiver.
 
 This method is nevertheless handy when you need to create a temporary UI element object; for example, an object representing a known UI element in order to test it for equality with a cached element using @link isEqualToElement: -isEqualToElement:@/link. You can allocate as many UI elements as you like in this way, as often as you like, and initialize each of them with <code>-initWithElementRef:delegate:</code>. Typically, in this situation, you get the <code>uiElementRef</code> argument from an existing or newly-created element by sending it @link elementRef -elementRef@/link, but you can also get it directly by calling any of several accessibility API functions.
 
 This method may return a PFApplicationUIElement object, substituting it for the PFUIElement object that was initially allocated. You must therefore always follow the convention of allocating and initializing a UI element object in a single statement in this form: <code>[[PFUIElement alloc] initWithElementRef:myElementRef delegate:MyObject]</code>.
 
 All PFUIElement objects except a PFApplicationUIElement object use internal mechanisms to learn when they are destroyed in the target application's user interface (for example, when a window closes), even if the client application does not register to observe <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code> or implement the @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link delegate method. Use @link exists -exists @/link to determine whether a PFUIElement object currently exists in the user interface. When an element is initialized, it caches information about itself that can still be accessed after the element is destroyed. See the @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link delegate method and @link elementInfo -elementInfo @/link for details.
 
 <b>IMPORTANT:</b> if you use <code>-initWithElementRef:delegate:</code> to create a new PFUIElement object to represent a UI element that has already been destroyed (for example, in response to a notification that it has been destroyed), the cached information in the newly-created object may be invalid. You should therefore substitute known good elementInfo, which you can obtain from the elementInfo that was cached in the destroyed PFUIElement object when it was initially created.

/*!
 @method isAccessEnabled
 @abstract Class method reports whether global access for assistive devices is enabled.
 @discussion Returns <code>YES</code> if global access for assistive devices is enabled in the Accessiblity (or Universal Access) pane of System Preferences.
 
 Enabling global access for assistive devices is usually done manually, although it can also be done using an AppleScript command addressed to AppleScript Utility. AppleScript Utility is a scriptable faceless background application in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and newer. Enabling this setting requires user authentication.
 
 Access for assistive devices is turned off by default, and client applications therefore cannot use the methods of the PFAssistive framework unless they arrange to turn it on. Assistive applications commonly instruct the user to turn on one of these settings manually. One technique is to send the <code>isAccessEnabled</code> message in a client application's <code>-awakeFromNib</code> method and, if the result is <code>NO</code>, present an alert explaining how the user can turn the setting on.
 
 A more user-friendly technique is to enable access for assistive devices for the user with an AppleScript command using Scripting Bridge. For this to work, the developer of an assistive application must use the sdef and sdp tools to generate a System Events.h header file, which must be added to the project before compiling. The SBApplication.framework must be linked. Here is an action method that toggles the state of the setting:
 
<pre>
 @textblock - (IBAction)enableAccessAllAction:(id)sender {
     SystemEventsApplication *systemEventsApp
    	  = [SBApplication applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@"com.apple.systemevents"];
     if ([systemEventsApp isRunning]) {
         [systemEventsApp activate]; // so authentication dialog opens frontmost
         [systemEventsApp setUIElementsEnabled:[PFUIElement isAccessEnabled] ? NO : YES];
     }
     [sender setState:[PFUIElement isAccessEnabled] ? NSOnState : NSOffState];
 } @/textblock
 </pre>
 
 The most sophisticated technique is to ask the user to make the assistive application trusted. See @link isProcessTrusted +isProcessTrusted @/link for information about making a client application trusted.
 
 See also @link isAccessImplemented -isAccessImplemented @/link and @link isProcessTrusted -isProcessTrusted@/link.
*/
+ (BOOL)isAccessEnabled;

/*!
 @method isProcessTrusted
 @abstract Class method reports whether the client application's process is trusted.
 @discussion Returns <code>YES</code> if the client applicatiion's process is trusted
 
 A trusted process is typically an assistive application that was made trusted by the user when it was installed or first run. This feature was originally part of Apple's movement away from the global on/off model of the Accessibility (or Universal Access) pane of System Preferences, toward a per-application security model. Individual assistive applications may be labeled as trusted in order to make use of the accessibility API without turning on access globally for all applications.
 
 A process is untrusted by default, and client applications typically cannot use the methods of the PFAssistive framework unless they arrange to enable access for assistive devices. See @link isAccessEnabled +isAccessEnabled @/link for information about enabling access for assistive devices.
 
 Assistive applications can use the trusted process technique to avoid forcing the user to enable access for all applications globally, which might be viewed as a security risk in sensitive environments. However, Apple's GUI Scripting technology for AppleScript requires that access be enabled globally, so an assistive application related to GUI Scripting should allow the user to enable global access.
 
 For an assistive application to become trusted, it must present an authorization dialog and then run a small embedded helper application as root to call the <code>AXMakeProcessTrusted()</code> function. The assistive application can use the SFAuthorization framework to present the dialog. The application should first call <code>isProcessTrusted</code> to test whether it is already trusted. Then, if it is not and if the user successfully authenticates, it should run the helper application to call the <code>AXMakeProcessTrusted()</code> function, passing in the path to the target application's executable. The assistive application must then be terminated and relaunched for its new trusted status to take effect. The helper application should be placed in the Resources subfolder in the assistive application's bundle.
 
 Note that the PFAssistive framework cannot be embedded in an assistive application's bundle. For security reasons, Apple prevents embedded frameworks from using the accessibility API. An assistive application must use an installer package, instead, to install the application and to install the framework in /Library/Frameworks/.
 
 The PFAssistive framework does not implement a Cocoa wrapper method for the <code>AXMakeProcessTrusted()</code> function, because it would not be prudent to run an assistive application as root. Instead, it is the developer's responsibility to implement a small helper application, give it root privileges, obtain user authorization, and terminate and relaunch the assistive application.

For example, it is necessary to make a target application's menu visible before its menu items can be sent AXPress actions, and menus are not visible when the application is not frontmost. The accessibility API is designed to emulate the experience of a typical user, and UI elements are generally not usable when they are not visible on the screen.
 
 If you call this method, it is your responsibility to return the client application to the front, if appropriate. You can call NSApplication's <code>-activateIgnoringOtherApps:</code> to do this.

 @discussion The AXUIElementRef object returned by this method can be used with accessibility API functions, passed to the @link initWithElementRef:delegate: -initWithElementRef:delegate: @/link method to create another PFUIElement object representing the same UI element, or passed to the @link setElementRef: -setElementRef: @/link method for a PFUIElement object that was initialized with a <code>nil</code> <code>uiElementRef</code> parameter.
 
 The returned AXUIElementRef object may represent a UI element that no longer exists in the running application.

It can always be used to test cached AXUIElementRef objects using <code>CFEqual()</code>; for example, to decide whether to remove them from the cache. For this reason, <code>-isEqual:</code> and @link isEqualToElement: -isEqualToElement:@/link can also be used with destroyed UI elements.

 @abstract Returns information about the receiver that was cached when the receiver was created, and that may have been modified later.
 @result An NSDictionary object using NSString constants from the NSAccessibility informal protocol as keys.
 @discussion When the UI element represented by the receiver is destroyed, the receiver can no longer be queried by the accessibility API for valid data about it (except for its process identification number, or PID). Any information about it that must survive its destruction therefore has to be cached when it is created. See @link elementRef -elementRef @/link for information regarding destroyed UI elements.
 
 The role and, if available, the subrole, role description and title of the receiver are automatically cached when a new PFUIElement or PFAppplicationUIElement object is created. Note that the title may have changed by the time the UI element is destroyed. To make the cached title useful, a client application can update the cache at any time by sending @link setElementInfo: -setElementInfo: @/link with an appropriate dictionary entry. To retrieve these values from the dictionary returned by this method, or to set them, use as keys the NSAccessibility informal protocol string constants <code>NSAccessibilityRoleAttribute</code>, <code>NSAccessibilityRoleDescriptionAttribute</code>, <code>NSAccessibilitySubroleAttribute</code>, and <code>NSAccessibilityTitleAttribute</code>, or their counterparts in AXAttributeConstants.h in the accessibility API cast to NSString*, or the strings themselves.
 
 If the client has registered to observe the root application element or the receiver for accessibility notifications, the client's callback method will always receive the affected element, even when observing <code>NSAccessibilityUIElementDestroyedNotification</code>.

 In Cocoa, the mouse location can be obtained at any time in bottom-left relative screen coordinates, regardless of the current event or pending events, using NSEvent's <code>+mouseLocation</code> class method. You must convert it to the accessibility API's top-left relative screen coordinates before passing it to this method.

 @method exists
 @abstract Returns whether the UI element represented by the receiver still exists in the running application.
 @discussion Returns <code>YES</code> if the UI element represented by the receiver still exists in the running application. Use this method to test, for example, whether an application's window is still open. This method is very fast, so it can and should be called liberally. 
 
 This method is important because the AXUIElementRef object associated with the receiver may be invalid if the UI element it represents has been destroyed; that is, if it no longer exists in the running application. A UI element can be destroyed under many circumstances, not all of them obvious. The accessibility API defines existence in terms of an element's availability in the user interface, rather than its programmatic availability. For example, a window UI element is destroyed when its application is hidden, even if the window object still exists in memory. To be prudent, you should not call any accessibility API function on a UI element that might have been destroyed without first sending it this message.
 
 You can, however, always safely get a destroyed UI element's @link pid -pid@/link, and you can always test destroyed PFUIElement objects for equality using <code>-isEqual:</code> or @link isEqualToElement: -isEqualToElement:@/link. You can also get information that was cached when a destroyed PFUIElement object was created, by sending @link elementInfo -elementInfo @/link to it.
 
 Due to the design of the accessibility API, some UI elements do not issue <code>NSAccessibilityUIElementDestroyedNotification</code> when the UI element containing them is destroyed, such as a Cocoa window's title and grow area elements. This method depends on this notification internally, so it will report that such elements still exist in the running application, although Apple advises that all UI elements descended from a destroyed element should nevertheless be considered destroyed. One way to deal with this issue is to explicitly mark all contained UI elements as destroyed when their container is destroyed, by sending @link setExists: -setExists: @/link to each of them with <code>flag</code> passed as <code>NO</code>. If this technique is not adopted, a prudent client should always anticipate that a PFUIElement object it is accessing might not exist, in case this method returns an incorrect result. There is no better way to deal with this issue; using an accessibility API function to access a destroyed UI element is not guaranteed to return an error because AXUIElementRef objects are recycled and therefore might refer to another valid UI element.
 
 A client can observe when a UI element is destroyed by calling @link //apple_ref/occ/instm/PFUIElement/setDelegate: -setDelegate: @/link to set itself as PFUIElement's delegate and implementing the @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed:@/link delegate method, or by registering with NSNotificationCenter to observe <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code>. As noted above, some elements do not issue a notification when their container is destroyed.
 
 For other issues relating to UI elements that have been destroyed, see the @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed:@/link delegate method.

/*!
 @method attributes
 @abstract Returns an array of the technical, non-localized names of all attributes recognized by the receiver.
 @result An array of NSString objects, or an empty array if the receiver does not recognize any attributes.
 @discussion Cocoa and Carbon target applications respond differently to this method. In general, Carbon target applications return only those attributes that are implemented by the receiving UI element, and all such attributes therefore have a value. Cocoa target applications return all attributes implemented in the receiver's class, whether or not a particular attribute for a particular UI element has a value. In cases where an attribute is not implemented, or is implemented but does not contain a value, the PFUIElement accessor method for that attribute returns <code>nil</code>. In all cases, an empty string is considered a valid attribute value.
 
 The preferred and most efficient way to get or set the value of an attribute of the receiver is to send one of the specific attribute accessor messages, such as @link AXRole -AXRole @/link declared in the Attributes category. The names of these accessor methods are identical to the technical, non-localized attribute strings declared in the accessibility API and returned by this method, including the "AX" prefix. The accessor methods are convenient to use and descriptive when you know the name of the attribute you want to access. The PFAssistive framework implements accessor methods for all attributes declared in the Cocoa and Carbon accessibility APIs (except those marked obsolete).
 
 While many specific attribute accessor methods apply to almost any kind of UI element, others apply only to particular kinds of UI elements. Where a specific accessor applies to a particular kind of UI element, this document indicates the kind by referring, for example, to the "receiving window," the "receiving menu item," the "receiving stepper" or the "receiving table view or outline view." Bear in mind, however, that applications are free to implement new kinds of UI elements and new attributes. Apple encourages developers to minimize the number of new attributes by reusing existing attributes for analogous new purposes wherever appropriate. As time goes by, therefore, existing attributes may apply to more and more kinds of UI elements. When in doubt, test the return value of an attribute for <code>nil</code> or an empty value, or use one of the <code>-exists...</code> methods. For specific usage information regarding individual attributes, consult the "Accessibility (ApplicationServices/HIServices) Reference" and the "Carbon Accessibility Reference" in the Xcode Documentation window.
 
 Another way to get or set the value of a non-parameterized attribute of the receiver is to send the generic messages @link valueForAttribute: -valueForAttribute: @/link and @link setValue:forAttribute: -setValue:forAttribute:@/link. They use key-value coding with keys generated by @link nonParameterizedAttributes -nonParameterizedAttributes@/link. They can be used instead of the specific accessor methods described above to get any non-parameterized attribute value using its NSAccessibility informal protocol constant, its accessibility API string constant cast to NSString*, or the attribute string itself. You must always use these two generic methods when you don't know which attribute you need, for example, when iterating over a list of attributes. The @link valueForAttribute: -valueForAttribute: @/link method automatically sends the appropriate specific attribute accessor method, if one exists for the attribute, and return an object of the appropriate type. It even returns the value of a non-parameterized attribute that is not covered by a specific accessor method, including attributes added to the accessibility API in the future or implemented in another application like the Finder or Safari, because the framework implements the Cocoa key-value coding fallback methods using whatever attribute strings you provide.
 
 This method also returns the parameterized attribute strings if the receiver is a text area or a text field. However, you cannot obtain or set the value of parameterized attributes using key-value coding in this version of the framework. For these, you must use the specific parameterized attribute accessor methods.
 
 A few applications may not expose the AXChildren attribute in the list of attributes for some custom elements, even though these applications may in fact support the AXChildren attribute. The accessibility API may not expose the AXChildren attribute on behalf of these applications, as it used to do. Pursuant to Apple's recommendation, this method therefore always includes the AXChildren attribute in the list for all UI elements. The PFAssistive framework will always return a value for this attribute for elements that support them.

 Use this method only when you wish to display a reasonable facsimile of the accessibility attributed string. For an assistive application, use the accessibility attributed string and its attributes, instead.
 
 An accessibility text attributed string is an NSAttributedString in the sense that it has a dictionary of attributes and responds to NSAttributedString methods. However, its attributes, declared in AXTextAttributedString.h, differ from the standard text system attributes, and it therefore cannot be used for display without first converting it using this method. An accessibility text attributed string omits many appearance-related attributes of a standard text system attributed string that do not convey meaningful information in the accessibility context, so an attributed string returned by this method may not look identical to the original attributed string in the target application. For example, baseline offset, kerning and ligature information is omitted, and double strikethroughs are not distinguished from single strikethroughs. Other standard text system attributes are included, such as foreground and background color, superscript and subscript, underline, strikethrough, shadow, link, and text attachment. An accessibility text attributed string also includes some attributes that are not recognized by the standard text system, namely, natural language, replacement string, and misspelled string.

 @method actions
 @abstract Returns the technical, non-localized names of all actions implemented by the receiver.

 @discussion The accessibility API implements relatively few actions, and many UI elements do not support any actions at all. Specific applications may implement custom actions, such as the AXOpen action in the Finder, and they are included in the array returned by this method.
 
 Sometimes performing an action and setting an attribute would achieve the same goal. In such cases, Apple generally prefers the action and makes the attribute unsettable. The prime example is checkboxes, whose value you set by sending them an AXPress action.
 
 A client application can test whether a UI element exists and supports a specific action with @link existsAction: -existsAction:@/link; it can get a localized description of an action with @link descriptionForAction: -descriptionForAction:@/link; and it can perform an action with @link performAction: -performAction:@/link.

 @method notifications
 @abstract Returns the technical, non-localized names of all notifications issued by the receiver.
 @result An NSArray of NSString objects. All UI elements issue some notifications.
 @discussion The accessibility API does not include a function to return the notifications issued by a UI element, so the list returned by this method is arbitrary and is only as current as the version of Mac OS X existing when this framework was last updated.
 
 The notifications returned by this method are based on the class of the receiver. The root application element reports all notifications that may be issued by any element in the application. Other elements report all notifications that might be appropriate to the nature and function of that element. Notifications returned by this method should be considered candidates until a particular application is tested. The only notifications that this method excludes are those that are plainly inappropriate for a particular element, such as menu notifications in the case of a window element, and window notififications in the case of a menu or menu item element.
 
 Apple discourages application developers from inventing new notifications, but there is no guarantee that they will not do so. The list returned by this method does not include any custom notifications implemented by third-party applications. If a client application must know of newer notifications or custom notifications implemented by other applications, it is the client's responsibility to provide them. An example of a user interface for letting users add new notifications is the Notifications pane in PreForm UI Browser's Preferences.
 
 The PFAssistive framework handles registration to observe notifications in the PFObserver class in PFObserver.h. In general, it is best to register to receive notifications on the root application UI element of the target application, because this guarantees that all notifications will be received from all UI elements affected by a user's activity in the user interface, even as to elements that don't yet exist at registration time. It might be sensible to register for notifications on a particular element if registering on the application element floods the client application with irrelevant notifications.
 
 Use the class method @link //apple_ref/occ/clm/PFUIElement/notifications +notifications@/link to get an array of all notifications recognized in the accessibility API.
 
 The following notifications are supported by the accessibility API (obsolete notifications are omitted):
 <ul>

 @category PFUIElement (Attributes)
 @abstract A category on PFUIElement for attribute properties and methods.
 @discussion The Attributes category on PFUIElement includes two kinds of attributes: nonparameterized attributes and parameterized attributes.
 
 The nonparameterized attributes are declared as properties. To use them, you send a <code>key</code> message to their receivers (where <code>key</code> is the property name, such as <code>AXRole</code> to read the "AXRole" attribute), just as you would use a getter accessor method. They take no parameters, and they return an Objective-C object. To set those that are settable, you send a <code>setKey:</code> message to their receivers passing an Objective-C object (where <code>setKey:</code> incorporates the property name, such as <code>setAXValue:</code> to set the "AXValue" attribute), just as you would use a setter accessor method.
 
 The parameterized attributes are implemented as methods. You send them to a receiver with a parameter, and the value returned depends on the value of the parameter.
 
 The accessor methods specified by the properties in the Attributes category on PFUIElement return UI element attribute values for attributes having the same name as the property. All attributes declared in the AXAttributeConstants.h and NSAccessibility.h headers are included (except where they are marked obsolete). Note that some attributes appear in only one of those headers.
 
 Individual properties are named according to the string value of the attribute, not its constant name in the AXAttributeConstants.h or NSAccessibility.h header. They are classified approximately the same as in AXAttributeConstants.h, which differs in minor ways from the classification in NSAccessibility.h. Classification of attributes is for ease of understanding only and has no functional significance. It can be misleading, because Apple encourages developers to use existing attribute names for custom objects where possible, and they may therefore be used for new purposes.
 
 The properties in this category are mostly for convenience. Instead of using them, you can send @link valueForAttribute: -valueForAttribute:@/link and @link setValue:forAttribute: -setValue:forAttribute: @/link with the appropriate accessibility API constant from AXAttributeConstants.h (cast to NSString*) or NSAccessibility.h. These two methods use key-value coding to find and send one of these properties by name or, if it is not found, to fall back on a private method that calls the accessibility API directly. The net effect is that the framework will always find all attributes, even new attributes that are added to the accessibility API in future versions of Mac OS X and custom attributes that are implemented by other applications such as the Finder and Safari. You must send @link valueForAttribute: -valueForAttribute:@/link and @link setValue:forAttribute: -setValue:forAttribute: @/link instead of a specific property when you don't know in advance which attribute to use, for example, when using a list of attributes obtained from the @link nonParameterizedAttributes -nonParameterizedAttributes @/link method.

 There is a slight efficiency advantage in sending an accessor message instead of using the -valueForAttribute: and -setValue:forAttribute: methods. Either technique will execute any special code, such as bug fixes, that is included in a particular accessor method.
 
 All attribute values are Objective-C objects returned autoreleased.
 
 See @link attributes -attributes @/link for information regarding the use of the attribute properties.

 @discussion An element's <code>AXParent</code> attribute represents the element containing it in the visual, on-screen accessibility containment hierarchy. This may not be its immediate container in the application's programmatic view hierarchy, because the view hierarchy often includes unseen objects that are irrelevant to accessibility and therefore ignored by it. For example, a drawer's parent is the window from which the drawer opened, not the unseen programmatic window object that contains the drawer's view. More conventionally, a push button's parent may be a group or a window, a window's parent is the root application element, a menu item's parent is a menu, a menu bar item's parent is the menu bar, and a menu's parent may be a menu bar item or a menu item.

For example, a window's children are the elements, such as buttons and text fields, that appear at the top level of the window, and a menu's children are its menu items.

 The @link AXParent AXParent @/link and <code>AXChildren</code> attributes are key players in an assistive application's navigation up and down a target application's accessibility containment hierarchy.
 
 A parent and its children must match in both directions. That is, a child's parent must have the child as one of its children, and a parent's child must have the parent as its only parent. Any failure of the accessibility containment hierarch to match in both directions is the result of an application bug. The bug may cause an element browser (which looks "up" the hierarchy from the "root" application element through its children) or a screen reader (which looks "down" the hierarchy from a "leaf" element on the screen through its parents) to fail. A surprising number of applications exhibit this bug with respect to some of their elements.

 @discussion Use the <code>AXInsertionPointLineNumber</code> attribute to determine whether a naked insertion point is at the end of one wrapped line or at the beginning of the next wrapped line of a word-wrapped line of text.
 
 This attribute returns a line number only if no text is currently selected. It returns <code>nil</code> if text is currently selected in the receiver.
 
 To determine the location of the insertion point as a character index, get the starting character index of the current selection range using @link AXSelectedTextRange AXSelectedTextRange@/link. The <code>location</code> field of the structure it encodes holds a character index representing the insertion point whether or not text is currently selected. If the length of the current selection is greater than 0, you can determine the line index of the insertion point (that is, the line on which the first character of the selection is located) without ambiguity by calling @link AXLineForIndex: -AXLineForIndex:@/link. The line index can be important, for example, when you want to scroll to the insertion point.
 
 To determine the line index of the insertion point when the length of the current selection is 0, two steps are required. This is because the character index is the same when there is no text selection and the insertion point is at the end of one wrapped line or the beginning of the next wrapped line (there is no return character separating wrapped lines). First, pass the character index of the current selection range to @link AXLineForIndex: -AXLineForIndex:@/link, as above, and note the result. Second, to distinguish between a naked insertion point that is located at the end of one wrapped line and one that is located at the beginning of the next wrapped line even though both have the same character index, use this property, <code>AXInsertionPointLineNumber</code>. If the result is <code>nil</code>, you know that the length of the current selection is greater than 0 and the line index returned by @link AXLineForIndex: -AXLineForIndex:@/link was therefore correct.

 To set the receiver to be the target application's main window, call <code>-setAXMain:</code> passing an NSNumber object encoding <code>YES</code>. Whether making a window the target application's main window brings it in front of other windows belonging to the application is application-dependent. To make another window the main window, you must send the <code>-setAXMain:</code> message to it; passing an NSNumber object encoding <code>NO</code> to this property does nothing.

 The modifier key combination is the Modifier Key Mask described in the Carbon Menu Manager documentation and declared in Menus.h in the Carbon HIToolbox framework.

The Command key is assumed unless bit 3 is set, and it is not included in the mask. Thus, for example, the number 0 means that only the Command key is required; 1, Command-Shift; 2, Command-Option; 3, Command-Shift-Option; 4, Command-Control; and so on.

The keys are prefixed with "AX" instead of "NS", as in "AXFont" instead of "NSFont", and their contents may differ from the contents of their standard text system analogs. They are declared in the AXTextAttributedString.h header.
 
 The accessibility attributed string returned by this method therefore cannot be displayed in a text view without first converting it to a standard attributed string. See @link attributedStringFromAXAttributedString: -attributedStringFromAXAttributedString:@/link for more information, and use that method to effect the conversion.
  
 The <code>characterRange</code> parameter can be any range of characters in a text object. To obtain a character range for a specific line in a text object, see @link AXRangeForLine: AXRangeForLine:@/link. To obtain a character range for a style run in a text object, see @link AXStyleRangeForIndex: AXStyleRangeForIndex:@/link.

 @protocol PFUIElementDelegate
 @abstract A formal protocol declaring delegate messages sent by PFUIElement.
 @discussion The PFUIElementDelegate protocol implements two optional delegate methods, @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link and @link PFUIElementReportError: PFUIElementReportError:@/link.
 
 Clients that implement either of these delegate methods must declare that they adopt this formal protocol.
 
 The PFUIElement.h header declares <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code>, an external notification posted when a UI element is destroyed in the user interface. Any client object can register to receive this notification. An object that implements the @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link delegate method is automatically registered to receive this notification.

// Clients that implement either of these delegate methods must declare that they adopt this formal protocol.

*/

/*!
 @method PFUIElementWasDestroyed:
 @abstract Sent when a UI element is destroyed.
 @param notification The notification parameter is always <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code>.
 @discussion Sent from the default notification center immediately after the receiving UI element is destroyed in the running application (for example, when a window closes).
 
 The notification parameter is always <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code>. You can retrieve the destroyed PFUIElement object by sending <code>-object</code> to <code>notification</code>. Beware the warnings about using destroyed PFUIElement objects described in @link elementRef -elementRef@/link.
 
 If this method is implemented in the client, the client is automatically registered for <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code> when you set the element's delegate. Other classes can register with the default notification center to observe <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code> without implementing this delegate method.
 
 If this element was registered by a client to be observed for accessibility notifications, destruction of this element will automatically unregister it for all registered notifications and update the observers' list of current registrations. This happens after this delegate message is sent and after <code>PFUIElementWasDestroyedNotification</code> is posted, to ensure that a client registered to receive <code>NSAccessibilityUIElementDestroyedNotification</code> from this element can respond before the registrations array is updated. (This means that implementors of this delegate method and observers of this notification must be aware that the current registrations array does not yet reflect the destruction of this element. If your delegate or notification method needs an up-to-date registrations array, you can force the registrations array to update by sending @link //apple_ref/occ/instm/PFObserver/unregisterForAllNotificationsFromElement:. -unregisterForAllNotificationsFromElement:@/link.)
 
 Some UI elements do not report when their container is destroyed, such as a Cocoa window's title and grow area elements. The @link exists -exists@/link method depends on this notification, so it will report that such elements still exist in the running application. See @link exists -exists@/link for techniques that can be used to deal with this issue.
 
 You can always safely get a destroyed UI element's @link pid -pid@/link, and you can always test destroyed PFUIElement objects for equality using <code>-isEqual:</code> or @link isEqualToElement: -isEqualToElement:@/link. You can also get information that was cached when a destroyed PFUIElement object was created, by sending @link elementInfo -elementInfo@/link, and the notification's <code>userInfo</code> dictionary also contains this information. See @link elementInfo -elementInfo@/link for information about the objects that are cached in the dictionary and their keys. The <code>userInfo</code> dictionary is autoreleased; the client must retain it if it is used.
 
 A PFApplicationUIElement object never reports when it is destroyed (that is, when the application quits). It does not send this delegate message and it does not post the corresponding notification.

 @class PFApplicationUIElement
 @abstract A concrete class representing the root application UI element of a running application or the system-wide UI element.
 @discussion A PFApplicationUIElement object represents the root application UI element of a running application or the system-wide UI element. It is a subclass of PFUIElement and inherits all of PFUIElement's functionality (except that it does not respond to the @link PFUIElementWasDestroyed: -PFUIElementWasDestroyed: @/link delegate method). It offers additional features for root-level UI elements (applications and the system-wide UI element).
 
 See the PFUIElement class description for more information.
 
 A client application may subclass PFApplicationUIElement. If it does so, it must register its Class object with PFApplicationUIElement so that PFUIElement methods that allocate and initialize a new root application UI Element will know what class of object to instantiate. 
 
 To register itself, the subclass must override +[NSObject load] like this:
 
 + (void)load {
 [PFApplicationUIElement registerApplicationUIElementClass:self];
 }

 Clients should not subclass PFUIElement, because they would lose access to PFApplicationUIElement. Instead, they should use categories or similar techniques to add functionality to PFUIElement (and, for that matter, to PFApplicationUIElement).
 
 Before a client application can make use of this class, the "Enable access for assistive devices" setting in the Accessibility (or Universal Access) pane of System Preferences must be turned on, or the client application must be made a trusted process through use of the accessibility API's <code>AXMakeProcessTrusted()</code> function. Authentication may be required.

 Use NSNumber's <code>-intValue</code> method to extract the integer value of the result.

 @method elementAtPoint:
 @abstract Creates and returns a PFUIElement object representing the visible UI element located at <code>point</code> on the screen belonging to the receiving application UI element.
 @param point An NSPoint struct using top-left relative screen coordinates.
 @result The PFUIElement object at <code>point</code>, or <code>nil</code> if the application does not own it.
 @discussion Use this method to read the screen, based, for example, on the current location of the mouse.
 
 Use the PFUIElement class method @link elementAtPoint:withDelegate:error: +elementAtPoint:withDelegate:error:@/link instead of this instance method to get a PFUIElement object representing the UI element located at <code>point</code> without regard to what application owns it.
 
 See PFUIElement's @link initWithElementRef:delegate: -initWithElementRef:delegate:@/link: method for important information.

 @method typeCharacters:keyCode:withModifierFlags:
 @abstract Posts keyboard events to the application represented by the receiver, whether or not it is the active application.
 @param characters An NSString object representing a Unicode character that can be generated by a single key press without modifier keys (Shift excepted).
 @param virtualKey The virtual key code provided by NSEvent's <code>-keyCode</code> method.
 @param flags An integer; either 0 for no modifier keys, or one or more of the first five key mask constants listed in NSEvent.h (combined using the C bitwise OR operator, if more than one) for modifier keys.
 @discussion Use this method to type one character at a time into the UI element that currently has keyboard focus in the application represented by the receiver (usually a text-based view or control such as a text view or a text field). Specifying the Command key in <code>flags</code> may be treated by the application as a keyboard shortcut for a menu item or button.
 
 Use @link typeCharactersSystemWide:keyCode:withModifierFlags: -typeCharactersSystemWide:keyCode:withModifierFlags: @/link instead of this method to type characters into the active application without first determining which application is active.
 
 The <code>characters</code> and <code>flags</code> parameters are equivalent to those used in NSEvent's <code>-charactersIgnoringModifiers</code> and <code>-modifierFlags</code> methods. The <code>virtualKey</code> parameter is the virtual key code provided by NSEvent's <code>-keyCode</code> method; it is a hardware-independent integer value provided by system resources for every known keyboard, mapped from the hardware-dependent raw key code using the current keyboard layout resource.
 
 On Roman systems, the <code>characters</code> parameter is optional and should be passed as <code>nil</code> or an empty string unless you are knowledgeable regarding the use of keyboard layouts, but it is not optional on some other systems where it is used as a hint to supplement the virtual key code during key translation.
